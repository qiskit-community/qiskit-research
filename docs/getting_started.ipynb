    "In general problems must respect the layout of the actual quantum hardware. Due to limited connectivity, this often entails doing SWAP operations to move quantum information around. SWAPs are costly in the sense they consist of three `CX`s. The Qiskit transpiler with `optimization_level=3` uses the [SABRE SWAP method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02573), which is efficient, however stochastic, since the SWAP-mapping problem is NP-hard. Here we do it several time and take the solution with the lowest CNOT count. This operation serves only to minimize the number of SWAPs in the transpiled circuits, and is not aware of noise on the underlying qubits. That is considered in a following step."

This method first uses a greedy algorithm called [template opimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05270) to identify parts of the circuit that can be substituted by $R_{ZX}$ rotations. If parameters are passed to the method via `param_bind`, it will bind them to the circuit and attach the necessary pulse gates for implementing the $R_{ZX}$ rotations (otherwise they can be bound and scaled later with `attach_cr_pulses`).

Considerations for which sequences to use may involve decoherent error due to idle time versus single-qubit gate errors and/or crosstalk during two-qubit gates.

Note that `cals_from_system` runs an experiment on your chosen `backend` and then applies it to your results to calculate quasi-probabilities, with the default `num_shots=8192`."
