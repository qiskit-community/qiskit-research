##############################

This template repository makes creating new quantum prototype projects much easier for our team. It reduces the overhead of implementing the "bones" of a project -- including package setup, testing, and CI/CD. The code examples in this template repository are written in accordance with pylint style checks, and the sample prototype_template module has an associated unit test module. We have also included examples of coverage testing, notebook tests, and notebook lint checks and wrapped all of these using tox automated testing software.
